# Example configuration for blacklisting conflicting GPU drivers
#
# Intel provides two graphics drivers:
# - i915: Legacy driver for older Intel GPUs
# - xe: New driver for modern Intel GPUs (Gen12+)
#
# You must blacklist one driver to prevent conflicts. Choose the
# appropriate driver for your hardware and uncomment the corresponding line.

# Uncomment to blacklist i915 when using xe driver
# blacklist i915

# Uncomment to blacklist xe when using i915 driver
# blacklist xe
